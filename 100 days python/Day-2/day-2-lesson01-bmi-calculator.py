Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

BMI Wikipedia Page

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
'''

# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = float(input())
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = float(input())
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

# Write your code below this line 👇

print(int(weight / (height**2)))

'''
Resposta:

height = input()
weight = input()
# Your code below this line 👇
weight_as_int = int(weight)
height_as_float = float(height)
# Using the exponent operator **
bmi = weight_as_int / height_as_float ** 2
# or using multiplication and PEMDAS
bmi = weight_as_int / (height_as_float * height_as_float)

bmi_as_int = int(bmi)
print(bmi_as_int)
